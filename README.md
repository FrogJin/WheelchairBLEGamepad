# Tim Multi-interfacing Device
### Northwestern master final project
Tim Multi-Interfacing Device turns mouse-like wheelchair interfaces into bluetooth xbox gamepad which enables disabled video game players to use their electric wheelchair interfaces
to play xbox supported games [(inspired by the Freedom Wing adapter designed by AbleGamers)](https://www.slashgear.com/freedom-wing-adapter-turns-electric-wheelchair-into-xbox-controller-31608250/).
There are two versions of design, details about the project could be found on [my portfolio page](https://frogjin.github.io/?project=mfp).
The project is still under development.

## Version 1
![Version 1](https://github.com/FrogJin/FrogJin.github.io/blob/master/files/projects/master_final_project/mfpversion1.jpg)
To use the first version, you need a Raspberry Pi (model 3 B+ tested), a working mouse, and a Linux device you want to connect with. For detailed instructions, please navigate to [version 1 instructions](version_1/README.md).

## Version 2
![Version 2](https://github.com/FrogJin/FrogJin.github.io/blob/master/files/projects/master_final_project/mfpversion2.jpeg)
To use the second version, you need everything for version 1, an additional nRF52840 module, and some additional wiring.
The second version is struggling with heavy delay for now. For detailed instructions, please navigate to [version 2 instructions](version_2/README.md).

## Future
Tim Multi-Interfacing device will add Android support, and additional data collection for [Argallab](https://www.argallab.northwestern.edu/) future studies.
